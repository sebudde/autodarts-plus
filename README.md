# Pimp My Autodarts

# DEPRECATED - NO LONGER MAINTAINED

## Please use [Autodarts Tools](https://github.com/creazy231/autodarts-tools) instead! ##

### All features of this script are included in Autodarts Tools. ###

Userscript to enhance [play.autodarts.io](https://play.autodarts.io).

**No official Autodarts Script!**<br>
Just a private project to enhance AD for personal use.

If you have questions, please first
**TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCREENSHOTS BELOW**.

- optimizes the layout for smaller screens (like iPad) (i.e. show/hide header)
- adds Autodarts Caller like [Autodarts_Caller](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/487034-autodarts-caller)
  from [MartinHH](https://greasyfork.org/de/users/158094-martinhh)</a> with
    - select a caller (-> configurable) (**it's working on iOS/iPadOS** ðŸ˜Š)
    - sound when Bot is throwing
    - boo-sound on miss (on/off)
    - sound on triple (off/beep/LÃ¶wen)
    - winner sound after match (set on config page)
    - sum of throws at end of leg (config page -> on/off/size)
    - works for X01 and Cricket games
- starts next leg after x sec (off / 0s / 5s / 10s / 20s)
- smaller font size for score of non-active players (config page -> on/off)</br>
  (like [Autodarts inactive player smaller points display](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/487524-autodarts-inactive-player-smaller-points-display))
- larger font size for PPR
- numbers on the board in match live view (on/off)

**because of copyright you have to define the caller data on config page** (but I'm sure you find the needed
information ðŸ˜‰)</br>
In Addition you can start a small local server to use your own caller soundfiles (
ie. [sheret](https://github.com/ethanpil/sheret) (Windows) or [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) (Node.js)).
